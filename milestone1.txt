I think your general concept here is a good one, and I really like that you're thinking in terms of functions and have already defined two of them that will probably be useful in your final project, at least in concept. You also do well at documenting this code, which is the major goal of this assignment. You need to, however, revisit your syntax: neither of the functions are declared correctly, and your variable creation is done backwards a few times, with a string equaling the variable you're trying to store it in. We can talk about this in person, but I recommend you review these syntax patterns ahead of our next milestone. You also need to look up the "raw_input" function to get user input in order to use later in the program. Let's talk in person about what you're trying to accomplish and how we might get it done.
