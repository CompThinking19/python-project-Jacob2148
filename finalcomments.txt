Comments
You have descriptive comments throughout that adequately describe what you're hoping to do with each section of the code. A bit more "why" would have been nice.

Code Quality
There are large sections of the code where I can see what you're attempting to do and the functions you define tend to make a lot of sense. However, those functions are never actually called, and there are things like if statements where the syntax is not correct.

Ambition
I think there's the start of a great project here. Your README could have been more detailed and included a project narrative, but the content that you have gives good justification for your project.

Aesthetics
You lay out the basics of what you set out to do in the code, even if it doesn't quite operate; what's present in the file squares with the intentions in your README.
