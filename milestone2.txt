Your code didn't run because of a missing colon during a function declaration, but you've otherwise made significant progress here in bringing this project to completion. There are some errors in the closing lines of your code where you call the function: you successfully call it, but your following if statements aren't actually testing what the user input, they're just empty statements. You're also, in those blocks, setting strings equal to other strings rather than creating variables. You're making progress here, but this still needs to be put together in service to something larger; the "game" piece still needs significant development.
